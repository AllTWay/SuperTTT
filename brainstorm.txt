 = Disconnect/Reconnect
When a player disconnects, the room is notified that a player disconnected
The opponent may leave the room or wait for its opponent
The disconnected player may reconnect to the game by joining the room directly
Creating a new game or joining the queue will not affect the ability to reconnect to the first game
